- Deploy Redis Cluster, implement data sharding to improve scalability and fault tolerance.
- Script to automatically initialize the cluster and assign slots.
- Integrate health checks for each node, alert when a node is down.
- Automatically add/remove nodes (scale out/in), script to automatically re-balance slots.

- Write a script to check data consistency between nodes.
- Use GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to build, test, and deploy.
- Write tests to check failover, replication, and cluster slots.
- Script to check data consistency after failover.
- Automatically rollback when errors are detected.
- Benchmark performance with redis-benchmark.

- Integrate security testing (scan config, check open ports, check password).
- Automatically send CI/CD result reports via email or chat.
- Integrate Prometheus + Grafana to monitor Redis.
- Alert via Slack, Email, Telegram when a node is down/failover occurs.
- Integrate centralized logging (ELK stack, Loki, etc.)
- Exporter for Redis (redis_exporter).
- Dashboard to display cluster/sentinel status.
- Script to automatically check logs and detect anomalies.
- Script to check memory usage, latency, slowlog.

- Connect the application to the cluster using a client that supports cluster mode.
- Demo a real application using Redis Cluster (cache, pub/sub, queue).
- Use clients that support cluster/sentinel (ioredis, redis-py, Jedis, etc.).
- Write demo app for cache, pub/sub, queue.
- Integrate Redis as message queue, session store, rate limiter.
- Write documentation for integrating Redis into popular frameworks.
- Demo automatic failover without service interruption.
- Build middleware cache with Redis.

- Set strong passwords, only open necessary ports.
- Enable TLS for Redis.
- Optimize maxmemory configuration and eviction policy.
- Restrict IP access, firewall.
- Script to automatically check security (open ports, password, config).

- Integrate Redis with Kubernetes (Helm chart, StatefulSet, Operator).
- Automate backup/restore of Redis data to cloud (S3, GCS).
- Optimize Redis operating costs on cloud (AWS ElastiCache, Azure Cache for Redis).
- Compare pros and cons between Sentinel and Cluster for each use-case.
- Evaluate Redis as a Service solutions (Upstash, Redis Cloud, etc.)
