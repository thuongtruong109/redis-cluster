## 🛠️ To-Do

- Automatically send CI/CD result reports via email or chat.
- Integrate Prometheus + Grafana to monitor Redis.
- Alert via Slack, Email, Telegram when a node is down/failover occurs.
- Integrate centralized logging (ELK stack, Loki, etc.)
- Exporter for Redis (redis_exporter).
- Dashboard to display cluster/sentinel status.
- Connect the application to the cluster using a client that supports cluster mode.
- Demo a real application using Redis Cluster (cache, pub/sub, message queue, session store, rate limiter.).
- Use clients that support cluster/sentinel (ioredis, redis-py, Jedis, etc.).
- Write documentation for integrating Redis into popular frameworks.
- Build middleware cache with Redis.

- Enable TLS for Redis.
- Optimize maxmemory configuration and eviction policy.
- Restrict IP access, firewall.
- Integrate Redis with Kubernetes (Helm chart, StatefulSet, Operator).
- Automate backup/restore of Redis data to cloud (S3, GCS).
- Optimize Redis operating costs on cloud (AWS ElastiCache, Azure Cache for Redis).
- Evaluate Redis as a Service solutions (Upstash, Redis Cloud, etc.)

## ✨ README

- 📷 Screenshots / Demo GIFs
  - Grafana Dashboard, Redis Commander, RedisInsight, `redis-cli cluster nodes` output, etc.
  - GIF demo for failover, scale-out/in, slot rebalancing.
- 🧩 Feature Comparison — Sentinel vs Cluster
  - When to use Sentinel vs Cluster? Pros & cons, suitable use-cases.
  - Examples: “Small session cache”, “pub/sub queue”, “large data partitioning”, etc.
- 📂 Example Applications
  - An `examples/` folder with 1–2 small apps (Node.js, Python, Java) using Redis Cluster / Sentinel — show how to configure clients, handle failover fallback, etc.
  - Each example should include a small README with run instructions.
- 🔐 Security & Hardening
  - Use TLS / SSL between clients & Redis nodes (if supported).
  - Configure `requirepass`, `masterauth`, `protected-mode`, firewall / network policies.
  - Restrict access from external IPs, or allow only internal container network.
- 📦 Detailed Backup & Restore
  - Not just backup scripts, but also recovery instructions, backup file management, rotation schedules.
  - Optionally integrate with cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- 📊 Monitoring & Alerts
  - Show how to use Prometheus + Grafana, exporters (e.g., `redis_exporter`), alert rules (e.g., node down, memory threshold, high latency).
  - Provide sample JSON dashboards and import instructions.
- 🌐 Kubernetes / Cloud Deployment
  - Deploy cluster + sentinel on Kubernetes: using Helm charts, StatefulSets, operators.
  - Guide for deploying on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) — network config, subnets, IAM, backup, monitoring.
- 🧪 Testing & Benchmarking
  - Benchmark scripts (read, write, throughput) for performance evaluation.
  - Compare latency and throughput during scaling, failover, and rebalancing.
- 📚 References / Learning Resources
  - List Redis articles, books, official documentation, blogs, cheat sheets.
  - Links to Redis docs, Sentinel, Cluster, best practices.
- 🛡️ Maintenance & Support Policy
  - Maintenance period, support scope, how to file issues, PR workflow.
  - Issue templates & contributing guidelines (highlight what already exists).
